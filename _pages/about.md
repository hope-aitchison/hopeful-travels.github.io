## Greetings, traveller

I am a London-based, ex-chemistry PhD student turned Technology Consultant (I know.. corporate sell-out). I love to stay active, creative, and curious. 

I have enjoyed travelling and exploring ever since I was a teenager, so thought I'd document my adventures both for myself and for anyone else who might find them useful or inspiring. So if you love the great outdoors, good food, bevs, and a good time, then we'll get along and I think you'll enjoy these posts.

<!-- I have laid out each post with all the necessary and practical details right at the top of the page. If you would to know and or care about my opinions on where I stayed and what I ate, or would like to see some visual accommpaniments, then read on! -->
