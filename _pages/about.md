Greetings, traveller. I am an ex-chemistry PhD student, turned Technology Consultant (I know.. corporate sell-out), who loves exploring and staying active and creative. I have always enjoyed travelling and exploring, and thought I'd document my adventures both for myself and for anyone else. So if you love the great outdoors, great food, beers, and a good time, then we'll get along, and I think you'll enjoy these posts.
