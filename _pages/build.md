## Blog build

Since I am technically a technology consultant, I thought I'd share my technical expertise and outline how I built this blog. There are many, many ways on how to build a blog, and mine assumes a relatively competent level of experience in development and IaC (infrastructure as code). I am by no means an expert; I'm using this as an opportunity to learn myself and expand my skillset. 

## The prerequisites
Homebrew
Code editor of choice (I use Visual Studio Code)
A Github account
Ruby
