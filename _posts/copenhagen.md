## Day one:
Flight from Gatwick 7 AM
Copenhagen 1 hour ahead, arrive around 11 AM
Rainiest day in Copenhagen in recorded history
Very easy to get from the airport to the city centre - metro 
Downloaded the DOT travel app and purchased a single journey
Travelled as far as Christianshavn metro and then had to walk 20 mins to our hotel, Hotel Admiral 
Could tell that on a nice day this would have been a very pretty walk - but we were under umbrellas 
Made it to the hotel and checked into our room - unpack and quick nap before setting out
Hotel is very grand, rooms are nice and cosy. They had a great November deal on when booking via their website of 3 nights for 2. Lovely Christmas decorations started to go up. Had some issues with our room which we reported before heading out.
Luckily rain died off a little but still very wet and cold
Walked down to Nyhavn and along the main avenue Gothersgade, past Rosenberg castle, to Torvehallerne food hall
Spent a few hours here, tried some Smorrebrod and shnapps (dill and rhubarb) and then coffee and pastries, was very cosy and everything was high quality and delicious.
Walked to a very nice brewery called Brus in Norrebro district - all the beers delcious, very cosy again. 
Walked to Norrebro Bryghus and went down to the basement bar, which was empty at first, and then started filling up with people. Turns out it was a singalong group choir / karaoke night. Stayed for three tracks (Aqua, backstreet boys, and Dolly Parton) before bf had reached his threshold of me belting out tunes and we went in search of dinner. 
Found a small hamburger place called Halifax burgers on the way back into town, and walked straight in and got a table for two. Portions were huge, excellent burgers. Had to leave most of the chips. 
When we got back the room issues hadn't been addressed so spoke to reception, who then upgraded us to a waterfront room on a higher floor. Result.

Day two:
Woke up mid morning after a very nice nights sleep. Hopped on the metro at Marmorkirken (bought a day pass) to Nordhavn to go to Juno's bakery. 
In the summer 100% would have walked along the harbour - but not in the cold grey - especially to go past the little mermaid and the Kastellet
Juno is a must stop. We got 4 pastries. Swedish bun with Saffron, two of their infamous cardamom buns, and an almond croissant. Saffron bun was the best. 
Needed coffee so went to Prolog Coffee bar right round the corner (Juno uses their beans and Prolog uses Juno's pastries). Tiny cafe but very nice coffee. Playing MUSIC
Walked down to Trianglen metro and popped back to hotel for a tea and to warm up a little. 
Walked down to Nyhavn, took obligatory photos, then walked down to the national library via the main harbour. Popped inside for another coffee and shared a warm smorrebrod. 
Walked along the very pretty Frederiksholms kanal, stopped to look at Christiansborg Slot (old royal palace now houses of parliament) and then spent a very pleasant few hours in the National museum of Denmark. Beautiful building and very well laid out exhibits. Personal favourite was learning about Danish colonies, in particular Greenland, and of course anything Viking-related. 
From here we walked down past the Tivoli gardens to the meat packing district. 
First stop was Mikeller bar which was packed - we had to stand by the door - but was worth it as the beer was delicious and vibes were great. Unexpectedly an accordion-playing Santa Claus turned up and started singing Danish christmas songs, and the bar staff handed out gift-wrapped cans of their alcohol-free winter ale (which was delicious!). 
Left here and walked to WarPigs - a canteen style barbecue and beer joint, playing rock and metal music. Not surprisingly it was packed, and mostly with men. You could't book a table here. Loitered at the side until we saw a window seat and swooped. Bart went up for beers, then I went up and ordered a huge tray of meat for us both to share. Came to about £60 - worth every penny. Beans were amazing. 
Got the metro from Kobenhavn H back to Marmorkirken, and had one more beer at a busy but cosy pub called Black Swan, then walked back to hotel. 

Day three:
Final full day and it was clear blue skies but freezing - literally 0 C. 
Walked across Inderhavnsbroen to catch a bus up to Refshaleoen, specifically to go to Hart's bakery. Most beautiful cafe ever. Clearly popular even though nowhere near the centre. People were cycling specifically to come here. There was even what looked like a Danish stag do outside (or just Danish lads starting their Saturdays with some pastries and a Carlsberg tinnies - no judgement here). Ordered their infamous cardamom croissant and just as infamous spandauer pastry. Both excellent - spandauer stood out especially. More lovely MUSIC. 
Got the bus to Gammel Strand where we joined a walking tour that we had booked onto. To be honest, a little cringe at first, but once we warmed up to our tour guide, it was pretty jokes. I would have liked a little more facts and history but that's just me. Covered Danish and Scandinavian history, Danish culture and politics, the Church in Denmark, and Copenhagen city, and the royal family. Top thing learned has to be the bluetooth symbol coming from Viking runes. 
After the tour we went to the hotel for a quick warm up tea. Then we walked north up the harbour towards Kastellet and the little mermaid. Spent a nice hour or so wandering around this pretty part of the city, then popped into the oldest coffee shop in Copenhagen, Kafferiet (nice but most expensive coffee I have ever bought... £6). 
From here we walked to sample two Copenhagen classic establishments - First stop was Gasoline Grill. Have to go - we only bought the burger (got a double) but hands down one of the best burgers ever consumed. Second was a hotdog stall - nice dogs, wouldn't necessarily go out of the way to get it, but a great small lunch / snack. We went to the Organic hot dog stand, next to Copenhagen tower. 
We got a delicious cup of Glog from a nearby Christmas market - the food and drinks here actually looked really nice, not like the gimicky overpriced tourist rubbish you get in London winter markets. 
Went back to the hotel to dress up for dinner - which was Restaurant Barr, sister restaurant to Noma and in its old digs. Beautiful decor and ambience - you feel like you're in a traditional Scandinavin cabin - staff were very friendly and right level of attentive. We  went for set menu and paired wine and beer flight. I'd actually say the drinks were the best and most interesting part of the meal, although bf loved the steak tartare. The desert was fantastic - the main was a bit disappointing. I think we should have chosen items from the a la carte menu, and asked them for a drink recommendation. Then I think it would have been a stand out meal. But for the price, it was really amazing, especially for Copenhagen standards. It was a lovely way to finish the weekend.
