Day one:
Arrive into the train station, from intercity train (coming from Katowice). Got a v cheap bolt taxi very easily - 15 mins to our airbnb. Very easy check in. 
Went for a wander, got a v good coffee from El Gato, had a look around the main square Wroclawski Rynek, and the university buildings, started scouting for dwarves, walked along the river to Targowa beer hall. Got a sharing board of bread and meats and pickled vegetables, and some craft beers. Started bar hopping and collecting more dwarves. Went to: 4Hops (nice but expensive), Browar Stu Mostow (where we got two tasting flights), and Kontynuacja (think it was good?). Great craft beer scene in Wroclaw!

Day two:
Breakfast on the main square at a Polish bakery called Hert - baked goods were good and coffee was average. Had pre-booked a walking tour with Walkative, met in the main square - the guide was very friendly, professional, and knew his stuff. Took us through Wroclaw's history, then up to Kamieniczki Medieval Houses and Gothic Church, walked along the river and through the university buildings, then Hala Targowa, got a great coffee here at Cafe Targowa, walked over the Most Piaskowy bridge and then Most Tumski taking in the views, and ended by Wroclaw cathedral. From here walked up to Bar Pierozek, had some AMAZING pierogis. From here we walked back over the river to wander through the city a bit more. Ended up at a bakery - baked goods were amazing (blueberry and pistachio something Polish), coffee was okay. Headed back to the apartment for a nap. Afterwards walked to dinner at a restaurant called Konspira - food was AMAZING but we weren't hungry enough. Had two soups (zurek and a cold beetroot special), a pork fillet and silesian roulade. 

Day three:
Got a tram out to Biskupin for parkrun - very nice out and back route along the river. After a quick shower, went for a delightful breakfast at Jolie cafe (shared a polish breakfast and marscapone pancakes with fresh orange juice). Walked across the square, nice antiques market next to the church with the bridge of penants, got an iced coffee from Kiosso coffee shop. Had some pre-booked tickets for the Panorma of the Battle of Raclawice - HIGHLY recommend, impressive artwork and very good audio guide, well worth it. From here got some wine and a cheese plate at a local market, tried some very good Polish white wines. Then a crazy storm came, so we hid in Targowa again and had some seasonal soup and veggie cheesy pancakes and a beer (mistake...). For dinner we walked along Bulwar Tadka Jasinskiego - really lovely walk - then found a gorgeous courtyard wine bar Winnica for a glass of white wine. Had a treat dinner at Mloda Polska bistro - live pianist, and for high end food, very big portions! We had croquettas, asparagus, pork schnitzel, duck leg with a red berry sauce silesian dumplings and a delicious, unusual white wine from Winnica Milsko, Muscaris Solaris 2022. Nice to see Polish wines to start to make their way onto the scene! Lovely staff and live piano player.

Day four:
Got the tram to the zoo! Was VERY good, lots of different animals, well maintained enclosures, very clean, not overly busy even on a sunny sunday. Got food in the restaurant - decent and not too expensive. Spent about 5 hours here and there was still more to see. From here did some beach bar hopping (Zazoo and Forma Plynna) and then scootered back into the city towards Bridge of Penants church. Climbed the stairs and got some sunset photos and enjoyed the view. Had a final beer on the square whilst the sun went down (£2.50 on the main square!!). Had two delicious pizzas at Iggy pizzas, and then gelato from tralalala cafe. 

Final morning:
Had an excellent coffee and breakfast from Yerba Mate cafe 3 mins from our apartment (healthy and delicious!) then got a 20 min Bolt taxi to the airport.
